Title: Demystifying how imports work in Python

Description:

It just so happens python abstracts away the inner workings of import statement beautifully. But are we aware of 
how python behaves when it encounters an import statement for a module? Better yet what is a module actually? 
Packages anybody? How would different import styles compare with each other. Any Best practices when importing 
modules. What about that __init__.py you saw the last time you read someone else's code.
